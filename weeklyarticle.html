<br> We also know that before the one child Policy, which limited the amount of children
 a couple could have, there were too many people for china to support.<br>
 Once the act was put in place they began to face another problem, too many elderly people to take care of.<br>
 We can all say that they need to think of 
 a something quickly and they did.<br> They claimed that a couple could have at most two kids instead of one. 
 This would help even them out but soon enough the elderly will die off<br> and there will be many more children causing
 the same problem they started with.<br> 
 There has also been a recent trend of Women seeking higher education. <br>
 Getting a higher education limits the amount of time they have to reproduce.</p>
